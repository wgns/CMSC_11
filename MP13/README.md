Make three (3) separate programs solving the following problems:

1. Ask the user to enter a measurement in kilometers (assume to be int and positive). Convert this into its equivalent in centimeters without using the multiplication operator. Name this file \<yourFamilyName\>5-1.c (e.g. dulaca5-1.c).

2. Ask the user to enter a positive number. Determine whether this number is prime or not. Name this file \<yourFamilyName\>5-2.c (e.g. dulaca5-2.c).

3. Ask the user to enter a number, say n (assume to be positive).  Print the first n elements of the Fibonacci sequence. For example, if n=8, then the values 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 should be displayed on the console. Name this file \<yourFamilyName\>5-3.c (e.g. dulaca5-3.c).
