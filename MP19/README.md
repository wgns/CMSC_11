Prompt the user with the following menu:

```
1. Hexadecimal to Decimal
2. Binary to Decimal
3. Exit
```

All the inputs in all the items must be string inputs and the outputs must be of integer type. For item 2, assume that the binary input is in a 32-bit system that can represent both positive and negative integers. For item 1, the user may use both the uppercase and lowercase letters. 

Recall that each character is just a number from 0-255. Use the knowledge that the characters from '0' - '9' are just numbers from 48 - 57. This means that converting the character '5' to its integer equivalent is a simple subtraction, i.e. '5' - 48 which gives you 5 because '5' is 53 and 53 - 48 is 5. The same can be applied with the letters from 'A' - 'F' and 'a' - 'f'. What are you going to subtract from 'A' which is 65 to give you 10 (since A in hexadecimal is 10)?

**Note: Erroneous/Invalid inputs must be properly handled.**
