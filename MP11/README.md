Make three different programs. Name each file yourFamily3a (for first file), yourFamily3b (for second file) and yourFamily3c (for third file).

1. Ask the user to enter a length and width of a rectangle. Compute and display the rectangle's area and perimeter. Area is length x width. Perimeter is 2 x length + 2 x width.

2. Ask the user to enter an amount in euros and the exchange rate (euro to peso) as well. Display the peso equivalent of the euro input. Notice that some euro amounts are of the form 5.75.

3. Ask the user to enter 4 numbers. Consider the first two as one fraction and the second two as another. Display in fraction form when the second fraction is subtracted from the first. Your answer is not necessarily in the lowest terms and should be in fraction form.

**Note: if you need to ask for multiple inputs, just the same, use scanf: `scanf("%i%i",&x,&y);`**
