Prompt the user a menu that looks like this:

```
Menu
1. Germain Primes
2. Perfect Numbers
3. Exit
```

When the user chooses item 1, ask the user to enter a positive number, say n. Then display to the user the first n Germain Primes. Assume that the first Germain prime is 2 (since 2 is prime and 2*2 + 1 is also prime).

When the user chooses item 2, ask the user to enter a positive number, say n. Then display the nth perfect number. Assume that the first perfect number is 6.

Prompt the menu again after the desired task is executed. The program exits when the user chooses item 3.
