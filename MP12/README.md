Problem A:

Tropical cyclones derive their energy from the latent heat of condensation which made them exist only over the oceans and die out rapidly on land. One of its distinguishing features is its having a central sea-level pressure of 900 mb or lower and surface winds often exceeding 100 knots. They reach their greatest intensity while located over warm tropical waters and they begin to weaken as they move inland. The intensity of tropical cyclones vary, thus, we can classify them based upon their degree of intensity. The classification of tropical cyclones according to the strength of the associated winds are as follows:

TROPICAL DISTURBANCE is a discrete weather system with an apparent circulation. It is characterized by a poorly developed wind circulation of weak velocities and with one or no closed isobars (isobars are lines of equal pressures). This is commonly observed throughout the wet tropics and sub-tropics.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION is a weak low pressure disturbance with a definite surface circulation having maximum wind speed of up to 63 kilometers per hour (kph) or approximately less than 25 mile per hour (mph). It has one or more closed isobars and is most common in the equatorial regions or intertropical convergence and less frequent in the trades.

TROPICAL STORM, a moderate tropical cyclone with maximum wind speed of 64 to 118 kph (25 to 75 mph) and with closed isobars.

TYPHOON, an intense tropical cyclone with maximum wind speed exceeding 118 kph.

All you have to do is ask the user to enter a wind speed (proper error checks must be made) and tell the user what kind of a tropical disturbance it is.

Problem B:

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAG- ASA) is a national institution under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST). It is dedicated to provide ﬂood and typhoon warnings, public weather forecasts and advisories, meteorological, astronomical, climatological and other specialized information and services pri- marily for the protection of life and property and in support of economic productivity and sustainable development. We have the following color-coded warning signals from the URL: http://www.gov.ph/how-to-make-sense-of-pagasas-color-coded-warning-signals/

Under the heavy rainfall warning system of PAG-ASA, a yellow rainfall advisory is raised when the expected rainfall amount is between 7.5 mm and 15.0 mm within one hour and likely to continue. Communities given this advisory are advised to be aware of the weather condition and warned that ﬂooding may be possible in low-lying areas.

The orange rainfall advisory is raised in areas where rainfall is between 15.1 mm and 30.0 mm within one hour. Flooding is a deﬁnite threat in communities under the orange alert.

A red rainfall advisory is issued when downpours constitute an emergency. This is raised when observed rainfall is more than 30.0 mm within one hour. When PAGASA raises a Red warning, communities should be prepared to respond. It means serious ﬂooding is seen and that residents should be ready to evacuate to safety.

For this problem, ask the user to enter the observed rainfall within the past hour (assume this to be in millimeters). Proper error checks must be made.  Then appropriately prompt the user with the corresponding PAGASA warning, if and when applicable.
