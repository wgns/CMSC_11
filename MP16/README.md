You were at the 2012 Olympics (hapit naman diay ang 2016 Olympics, Rio Babeh!). You were watching Gymnastics at the National Indoor Stadium in London.

There were ten judges in the Stadium. Another ten judges were at a remote venue. The judges give the gymnasts a score from 1 - 10 (they can give scores such as 9.3, 8.5 as well).

You were not satisfied with the display of the scores of the gymnasts in the stadium because no average is displayed. Since you brought with you your Mac, you decided to make your own program for the average score.

You stored the scores of the judges in Stadium in one array. The judges' score from the remote venue were stored in a separate array.

You create a third array and copied the judges' (the 20 judges) scores in this third array. You then computed the average of the scores given by the judges. In computing for the average, the minimum and the maximum scores were not included (whenever there were duplicates for the minimum, you excluded only 1. The same went for the maximum). You then displayed the average. Also, you displayed the judges (and the score) who gave the gymnast the lowest and highest scores, one set from the stadium judges and another from the remote judges.

For simplicity, refer to the judges as judge 1, judge 2, judge 3, ... judge 10 (two sets, 1 set from the stadium, another from remote).
