Prompt the user with a menu that looks like this:

```
1. Largest
2. Series
3. Base 8 to Decimal
4. Exit
```

The following are the descriptions for the items (a function for each of the items should be implemented. If you feel the need to create the additional functions, then do so.

1. The user should enter 3 numbers. Pass these 3 numbers as arguments in a function that returns the largest among these 3 inputs. Display the largest (the function should not display anything). Sample: 5 7 1, the largest among the 3 is 7.

2. Observe the series following series: 4 8 7 14 12 16 21 28 20 24 35... Ask the user to enter a number n.  Pass this number to a function that displays the first n elements of the series. If n = 5, then the display is 4 8 7 14 12.

3. Ask the user to enter a number in base 8. Pass this number to a function that converts the base 8 number to its decimal equivalent. Error checking must be made since the number input should not contain any digits greater 7.
